# hangman
A classic game built with JavaScript!
Enter 'node .' into the console to activate the hangman game. You will be prompted to enter your name. If you don't enter a name, the game will not start.
Once you enter your username, an array of dashes representing the amount of letters in the word will appear.
Enter your first guess*. If the guess is in the word, it will appear in it's appropriate position. If the letter you guess is NOT in the word, you will see a part of the 'hangman' and can guess again.
You can guess up to SIX incorrect letters** before the entire 'hangman' is displayed, and you lose the game. If you guess all the correct letters before the man is displayed, you win!
Play as many rounds as you like, and your win stats will appear after each round.
When you get tired of playing, just press 'Ctrl + c' to quit the game.

*You must enter a letter for it to be a valid guess. Special characters, numbers, and more than one letter per guess will not count against you.
* *If you accidentally guess the same letter twice, it will not count against you.
